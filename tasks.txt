  Tasks
  - Docs sync: Update README and docs/implementation-status.md to match current
    features (GUI implemented, gen for multiple slicers, new CLI commands like
    slice and gui-screenshot). Fix plan.md/spec.md stale “specs/001-opk” pointers.
  * GUI polish: Add minor UX touches (persist last-used bundle path, tighter
    error messages, small layout tweaks) and finish any missing tool wiring you
    want.
  * Spool clients: Implement basic read/search for Spoolman/TigerTag/OpenSpool
    in opk/integrations/spool_clients.py (currently stubs).
  * Firmware rules: Expand firmware-specific validations in opk/core/rules.py
    and surface more contextual tips in the GUI.
  
  * Packaging: Add optional extras in pyproject (e.g., gui, nfc) and a minimal
    release checklist.
  
  * Add persistence for G-code preview/validate dialogs too?
  * Wire a “Browse…” button for the bundle path in Generate Profiles?
  * Update docs to reflect new persistence behavior and tips?
  * Generate Profiles: add bundle \"…\" picker; keep enablement in sync
  * G-code Preview: persist PDL path, vars JSON, and hook selection
  * README + CLI Reference: add GUI Tips section
  * System Notes + Changelog: record persistence and bundle picker changes"
  
  * Docs sync: Update implementation-status and project-status to reflect
    working slicer generators and CLI gen.
  * Rules: Expand firmware-specific rule checks and linting (e.g., nozzle/
    filament mismatches).
  * GUI polish: Small UX improvements in the install wizard and generate
    dialogs; persist more defaults.
  
  * Packaging: Improve CLI/GUI packaging notes and add release workflow stubs.
  * Generators: Tweak mappings and add more parameters for Cura/Prusa/Bambu/
    SuperSlicer/ImageMaker, etc. outputs.
  * Add a path-only filter dropdown (e.g., machine_control, process_defaults,
    gcode)?
  * Show inline hints near additional fields (e.g., camera before/after flags)?
  
  * Sync the manual sections into the docs site structure.
  * Add screenshots in the manual (using the existing GUI screenshot tool).
  * Expand advanced sections (project policies, PDL schema reference, generator
  mappings).
  
  * Expand French/German/Portuguese manuals and add CLI/Overview translations for those languages too?
  * Tighten the exact key extraction (e.g., include JSON keys for Orca outputs)
  * Add a README “Translations” section with links to the translated manuals?
  
  - Add a PyPI publish workflow (manual trigger) to complement the checklist.
  * Add a README “Translations” section with links to the translated manuals
  - Split the README “Quickstart” into core vs GUI sections referencing extras.
  
  - Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing for this repo (recommended) or set TestPyPI in the workflow.
  - Optional: add a release badge and/or a matrix for building wheels on multiple OSes for smoke tests.
  - Want me to create a tag and walk through a TestPyPI dry-run?


    Here’s a crisp next-steps plan, prioritized for impact and momentum.

  - Developer Experience
      - Add dev extra in pyproject: pytest, ruff, black, pre-commit; wire a lint job (ruff + black --check) in CI.
      - Add CONTRIBUTING.md with setup, dev extras, pre-commit, testing, release notes flow.
  - Docs Polish
      - Sync Implementation Status and Project Status with recent changes: path filters, inline hints, generators’ new mappings, translations, key extraction automation.
      - Update docs/translations.md to list FR/DE/PT and link to their CLI/Overview pages.
      - Add “Translations” links to docs/index.md (landing page) for easy discovery.
  - Releases
      - Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing on PyPI (owner action) to match
  release.yml.
      - Optionally add a “release” badge and a small smoke wheel build matrix step to CI.
  - Generators + Rules
      - Add more PDL→slicer mappings where easy wins remain (supports/patterns for Prusa/SuperSlicer; additional Cura keys if desired).
      - Expand firmware-specific validations (e.g., more nuanced Bambu/Repetier/Smoothie tips).
  - UI Enhancements
      - Consider a Process Defaults tab with editable speeds/retraction/cooling and inline hints (currently implied via PDL and rules, but not a dedicated tab).
  - Spool Clients
      - Fill out any missing CRUD/mapping gaps per source (beyond the basic/search paths used in tests) and enrich normalized output docs.

  If you want me to start implementing now, I propose:

  - Implement dev extra + ruff/black config + lint workflow, update CONTRIBUTING.md, and sync the status docs.


- Add a concise Process Defaults subsection in docs/overview.fr/de/pt and
  manuals for parity.
  - Add a small rules summary label in the Process Defaults tab (currently the
  header hint shows it; I can make it explicit like “errors=X warns=Y” if you
  prefer).
  - Add generator mappings for additional patterns (e.g., wall line counts in
  Orca if relevant) and cover with tests.
  - Refine ideaMaker/KISSlicer keys if you have specific target keys you want
  to match.
