  Tasks
  - Docs sync: Update README and docs/implementation-status.md to match current
    features (GUI implemented, gen for multiple slicers, new CLI commands like
    slice and gui-screenshot). Fix plan.md/spec.md stale “specs/001-opk” pointers.
  * GUI polish: Add minor UX touches (persist last-used bundle path, tighter
    error messages, small layout tweaks) and finish any missing tool wiring you
    want.
  * Spool clients: Implement basic read/search for Spoolman/TigerTag/OpenSpool
    in opk/integrations/spool_clients.py (currently stubs).
  * Firmware rules: Expand firmware-specific validations in opk/core/rules.py
    and surface more contextual tips in the GUI.
  
  * Packaging: Add optional extras in pyproject (e.g., gui, nfc) and a minimal
    release checklist.
  
  * Add persistence for G-code preview/validate dialogs too?
  * Wire a “Browse…” button for the bundle path in Generate Profiles?
  * Update docs to reflect new persistence behavior and tips?
  * Generate Profiles: add bundle \"…\" picker; keep enablement in sync
  * G-code Preview: persist PDL path, vars JSON, and hook selection
  * README + CLI Reference: add GUI Tips section
  * System Notes + Changelog: record persistence and bundle picker changes"
  
  * Docs sync: Update implementation-status and project-status to reflect
    working slicer generators and CLI gen.
  * Rules: Expand firmware-specific rule checks and linting (e.g., nozzle/
    filament mismatches).
  - GUI polish: Small UX improvements in the install wizard and generate
    dialogs; persist more defaults.
  
  - Packaging: Improve CLI/GUI packaging notes and add release workflow stubs.
  - Generators: Tweak mappings and add more parameters for Cura/Prusa/Bambu/
    SuperSlicer/etc. outputs.
  - Add a path-only filter dropdown (e.g., machine_control, process_defaults,
    gcode)?
  - Show inline hints near additional fields (e.g., camera before/after flags)?
  - Add similar “Check…” affordances to other tabs (Extruders, Multi-Material)
    even if rules are limited today?
  
  * Sync the manual sections into the docs site structure.
  * Add screenshots in the manual (using the existing GUI screenshot tool).
  * Expand advanced sections (project policies, PDL schema reference, generator
  mappings).
  
  - Expand French/German/Portuguese manuals and add CLI/Overview translations
    for those languages too?
  - Tighten the exact key extraction (e.g., include JSON keys for Orca outputs
    if desired)?
  - Add a README “Translations” section with links to the translated manuals?
  
  - Add a PyPI publish workflow (manual trigger) to complement the checklist.
  - Add a simple dev extra (pytest, ruff/black) for contributors.
  - Split the README “Quickstart” into core vs GUI sections referencing extras.
