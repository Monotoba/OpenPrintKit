# Implementation Status

This document tracks major features, their implementation status, and next steps.

## Feature Matrix

- PDL Schema
  - [x] Core profiles (printer/filament/process) via JSON Schema
  - [x] Limits (speed/accel/jerk)
  - [x] Materials (embedded filament presets)
  - [x] Features → probe.active_low and endstops polarity
  - [x] Comprehensive G-code hooks + macros + generic hooks map
  - [x] Structured machine_control (PSU, lights/RGB, fans, chamber, camera, SD logging, exhaust, aux_outputs, custom_peripherals)
  - [x] OpenPrintTag metadata
  - [x] RRF-friendly string pins for outputs

- Core/Generators
  - [x] Render hooks with machine_control
  - [x] Firmware policies (Marlin/RRF/Klipper/GRBL/LinuxCNC)
  - [x] OpenPrintTag injection
  - [x] Generate start/end snippets
  - [ ] Slicer-specific generators (Orca, Cura, Prusa, Bambu)

- CLI
  - [x] validate, rules, bundle, install, convert(cura)
  - [x] gcode-hooks, gcode-preview, gcode-validate
  - [x] pdl-validate (schema + rules)
  - [x] tag-preview
  - [x] gen-snippets
  - [ ] gen (PDL→slicer profiles)

- GUI
  - [x] Tabbed PDL editor (Build Area/Extruders/Multi-Material/Filaments/Features/Machine Control/Peripherals/OpenPrintTag)
  - [x] Polygon bed editor + limits group
  - [x] Peripherals: lights, camera, fans, SD, exhaust, aux outputs
  - [x] Custom Peripherals list (Add/Remove) with dynamic hook selector
  - [x] G-code tools (Preview, Validate)
  - [x] Settings dialog (defaults + policies)
  - [x] Help pages (Overview, G-code Help, Firmware Mapping, M-code Reference)
  - [ ] Tools → Generate Snippets… (invoke CLI core with defaults)
  - [ ] Project-level config management (optional)

- Rules & Validation
  - [x] Basic rules for machine_control consistency
  - [ ] Expanded rules per firmware (narrow warnings based on target)

- Docs
  - [x] Firmware Mapping, Overview, G-code Help, CLI Reference, M-code Reference
  - [x] System Notes (this session) and Implementation Status
  - [ ] Slicer generator documentation (once implemented)

## Achievements

- Established robust schema for PDL including lifecycle hooks, machine control, and metadata.
- Built GUI editor with comprehensive tabs and contextual firmware tips.
- Added firmware-aware generation policies and CLI tools to preview/validate and produce snippets.
- Documented the system (firmware mapping, G-code usage, CLI reference) and integrated help into GUI.
- Ensured changes are tested (29 tests passing) and committed incrementally.

## Next Steps

1. Implement PDL→slicer generators
   - OrcaSlicer: emit printer/filament/process JSON and bundles.
   - Cura: refine convert/generate paths.
   - Prusa/Bambu: define mappings; decide on profile format.

2. Extend firmware mappings
   - Bambu and Repetier/Smoothie nuanced behaviors.
   - GUI tips reflecting those nuances.

3. GUI Enhancements
   - Tools → Generate Snippets… action using Settings.
   - Optional project-level config files for per-project defaults.

4. Validation & Rules
   - Expand rule checks for more firmware-specific guidance.
   - Lint common pitfalls (e.g., mismatched nozzle/filament diameters).

5. Packaging & Distribution
   - CLI/GUI packaging guidance, CI workflows, and release notes.
