# OpenPrintKit Project — Empowering the 3D Printing Community

## An Open Letter to 3D Printing Creators, Reviewers, and Enthusiasts

Dear Creator,

OpenPrintKit is an open-source initiative to unify how printers, slicers, and filament spools communicate. Whether you’re a maker, reviewer, or educator, your voice can help shape the next generation of open 3D printing standards.

### The Vision

We’re building a universal foundation that connects printers, slicers, and spools — automatically.
No more guessing extrusion temps, re-tuning flow rates, or recreating printer profiles for every slicer.

OpenPrintKit combines three key efforts:

- **Printer Definition Language (PDL)** — a human-readable format that describes printer features, build volume, firmware commands, and tuning options.
- **OpenTagKit** — an open, extensible system for identifying and managing filament spools using RFID/NFC tags, modeled after the Prusa Open Filament standard but designed for all printers.
- **Open Materials Database** — a community-driven library of filament definitions that any slicer or printer can access.

### Why It Benefits Everyone

- **For Makers:** Automatic setup of filaments and printers, regardless of brand.
- **For Reviewers:** Easier comparison of materials and hardware — data is open and consistent.
- **For Developers:** Shared specs reduce fragmentation across slicers and firmwares.
- **For Manufacturers:** Transparent platform to publish verified filament data.

### Target Compatibility

OpenPrintKit is being designed to interoperate with major platforms, including:
Prusa, Bambu Labs AMS, Klipper, Marlin, OrcaSlicer, Cura, and OctoPrint.
(Not all integrations are complete — development is ongoing in pre-alpha.)

### Join the Movement

We’re inviting creators and innovators like you to help shape the standard, test new tools, and spread awareness through reviews, videos, and maker communities.

You can follow development, contribute ideas, or join the **OpenPrint Working Group** through GitHub discussions and email.

Let’s make 3D printing more open, connected, and effortless — together.
