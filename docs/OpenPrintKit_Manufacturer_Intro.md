# OpenPrintKit Project — Open Standards for 3D Printing

## An Open Letter to 3D Printer and Filament Manufacturers

Dear Manufacturer,

The OpenPrintKit Project invites you to participate in building a new open standard for 3D printer interoperability and filament identification. Our mission is to simplify the user experience while providing manufacturers with a transparent, extensible platform that promotes compatibility and innovation across the industry.

### Why It Matters

Today’s 3D printing ecosystem is fragmented. Each printer, slicer, and filament system maintains its own profile format, setup process, and proprietary spool identification. This prevents true interchangeability between brands and complicates life for users and developers alike.

OpenPrintKit, along with its companion OpenTagKit, provides an open foundation for:

- **Printer Definition Language (PDL)** — a universal description format for machine capabilities, gcode dialects, and material parameters.
- **Open Filament Tag System** — a free, manufacturer-neutral standard for RFID/NFC filament spool identification, based on and extending the open Prusa tag concept.
- **Open Materials Database** — a shared and versioned registry where manufacturers can publish their official filament data, accessible to slicers and printers worldwide.

### Benefits for Manufacturers

- **Brand Visibility:** Your materials can be automatically recognized by compatible slicers and firmware.
- **User Satisfaction:** Eliminate the guesswork in filament setup — printer and slicer settings become automatic.
- **Reduced Support Load:** Consistent metadata ensures fewer failed prints and easier troubleshooting.
- **Industry Leadership:** Demonstrate commitment to openness and standards while maintaining your brand identity.

### Compatibility Targets

OpenPrintKit aims for compatibility with major ecosystems including:
Prusa, Bambu Labs AMS, Klipper, Marlin, OrcaSlicer, Cura, and OctoPrint.
(Integration with these platforms is ongoing as of the pre-alpha phase.)

### Join the Working Group

We are forming the **OpenPrint Working Group**, a collaborative body of manufacturers, developers, and maintainers dedicated to guiding the standard, managing the shared database, and ensuring long-term sustainability.

Your expertise and participation are vital to ensuring that this open standard benefits both industry and users.

We invite you to contact us or join the conversation through our GitHub project.
